# 📁 File Management System – Secure File Handling & Network Transfer

## Overview

This File Management System is a technically advanced C-based application developed as part of the *Operating Systems (CMP020N202A)* module at the **University of Roehampton**. Designed and implemented on macOS using **Xcode**, this project demonstrates a strong command of low-level programming, secure file operations, and client-server communication. 

While rooted in academic study, the system includes multiple self-directed enhancements — such as encryption and secure file transfer — showcasing initiative and an applied understanding of real-world software security concerns.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔧 File Operations
- **Create/Delete Files**: Intuitive functionality to generate or remove files from the filesystem.
- **File Merging**: Seamlessly merges two files and outputs the result to a specified directory — useful for data consolidation and management.

### 🔐 Access & Security
- **Password Protection**: Basic authentication system for access control during sensitive operations.
- **Permission Handling**: Ensures only authorized users can perform certain file operations.
- **File Encryption/Decryption**: Safeguards content by allowing files to be encrypted and decrypted using symmetric encryption logic.

### 🌐 Network File Transfer (Client-Server Model)
- Developed `client.exe` and `server.exe` as part of a self-initiated extension.
- Enables **secure file transmission** over a network using socket programming.
- All transfers are permission-controlled and encrypted during transit to prevent interception and unauthorized access.
